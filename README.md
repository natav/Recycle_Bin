Recycle_Report
===========

Collects data about residential buildings not having recycling bins/container (Reno, NV).

Data visually presented as markers on the Google map.

Data gets recorded into the SQL Server database table, data recorded: entered address, latitude and longitude of the location, comments, date time of the request.

On submission email is generated to notify responsible authority about a new request.


Future Web app:
-	Would be good to have a mobile version;
-	Can be part of the Cityâ€™s Web site;
-	SQL data can be used internally by the city for reporting purpose or visualization; also new form can be put on top of it to manage distribution of the bins/containers. (There is a Flag on each submitted record in the table, so it can be reset when request is fulfilled).
